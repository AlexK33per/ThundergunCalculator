# ThundergunCalculator
 This is a little zombie calculator for Call of Duty: Black Ops zombie mode that allows you to know how many ThunderGun shots you should do to pass the round.

 This my very first program. It's very very simple, but this is a start for something that could be too much bigger than this. Special thanks to @GashyDev that have
 helped me in this little program.

 Enjoy, and if you like, you can tell me in twitter! @alexxistyping.
